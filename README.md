### Technology Stack

#### Core Libraries (CDN)
- **Marked.js** (v11.1.1) - Markdown parsing
- **Mermaid.js** (v10.6.1) - Diagram rendering
- **Panzoom** (v4.5.1) - Interactive pan/zoom functionality
- **Highlight.js** (v11.9.0) - Code syntax highlighting

#### Why CDN?
- Zero build step required
- Instant setup - just open `index.html`
- Always up-to-date libraries
- Fast loading from CDN caching

### Example Files

Try the viewer with any `.md` file containing Mermaid diagrams to explore the interactive features.

### Features in Detail

#### Diagram Interaction

Each Mermaid diagram is automatically enhanced with:

1. **Control Panel**
   - Positioned in top-right corner
   - Always accessible (not affected by zoom/pan)
   - Consistent across all diagrams

2. **Zoom Functionality**
   - Button zoom: 0.2x increments
   - Mouse wheel: Smooth, continuous zoom
   - Range: 0.5x to 5x (10x in fullscreen)

3. **Pan Functionality**
   - Click and drag anywhere on diagram
   - Cursor changes to indicate drag state
   - Smooth GPU-accelerated movement

4. **Fullscreen Mode**
   - Darkened backdrop for focus
   - Diagram centered and maximized
   - Controls remain accessible
   - Extended zoom range (up to 10x)
   - Click outside or press ESC to exit

#### Theme Support

- **Light Theme**: Clean, bright interface for daylight use
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for low-light environments
- **Automatic Diagram Theming**: Mermaid diagrams adapt to theme
- **Persistent Preference**: Theme choice saved in browser

#### File Handling

- **Accepted Formats**: `.md`, `.markdown`
- **Drag & Drop**: Anywhere on the drop zone
- **File Validation**: Checks file extension before loading
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid files
- **Memory Management**: Cleans up resources when loading new files

### Troubleshooting

#### Diagrams Not Rendering

**Problem**: Mermaid diagrams show as code blocks instead of diagrams.

**Solution**: 
- Ensure code blocks are marked with `mermaid` language:
  ````markdown
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A --> B
  ```
  ````
- Check browser console for Mermaid syntax errors

#### File Won't Load

**Problem**: Drag and drop or file selection doesn't work.

**Solution**:
- Verify file has `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Try opening in a local server instead of `file://` protocol
- Check browser console for errors

#### Zoom/Pan Not Working

**Problem**: Interactive controls don't respond.

**Solution**:
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check that diagram rendered successfully (no error messages)
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify browser compatibility

#### Theme Not Persisting

**Problem**: Theme resets to light on page reload.

**Solution**:
- Enable localStorage in browser settings
- Check that cookies/storage aren't being cleared
- Try incognito/private mode to test

### Performance Tips

#### Large Documents
- Documents with many diagrams load sequentially
- Scroll to diagram to trigger panzoom initialization (lazy loading)
- Consider splitting very large documents

#### Complex Diagrams
- Use fullscreen mode for detailed exploration
- Reset view if performance degrades
- Simplify diagram if rendering is slow

### Desktop App (macOS)

#### Download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](../../releases).

> **Note:** The app is unsigned. On first launch, right-click the app and select **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper. Alternatively, run `xattr -cr /Applications/Specdown\ Desktop.app` after installing.

#### Install

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg`
2. Drag **Specdown Desktop** to your Applications folder
3. Right-click > **Open** on first launch

### Releasing

The release pipeline is fully automated. Every merge to `main` triggers the following sequence:

1. **Version Bump** -- The "Bump version on merge" workflow runs `npm version patch`, creating a new version commit and git tag (e.g., `v0.0.46`), then pushes both to `main`.
2. **DMG Build** -- The "Build Desktop App" workflow detects the version bump, checks out the tagged code on a macOS runner, and runs `npm run desktop:build` to produce a `.dmg`.
3. **GitHub Release** -- The DMG is uploaded to a GitHub Release matching the new tag. The release is created automatically if it does not already exist.
4. **Web Deploy** -- Simultaneously, the "Deploy static content" workflow deploys the latest web app to GitHub Pages.

#### Downloading the DMG

Go to the repository's [Releases page](../../releases) and download the `.dmg` file from the latest release.

#### Manually Triggering a Build

If the automated build did not run (or you need to rebuild):

1. Go to **Actions** > **Build Desktop App** in the repository.
2. Click **Run workflow** and select the `main` branch.
3. The workflow will build a DMG and attach it to the most recent tag's release.

#### Building a DMG Locally (macOS only)

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop:build    # produces a .dmg in dist/
```

### Development

#### Running the Desktop App from Source

**First-time setup:**
```bash
cd specdown               # navigate into the project directory
npm install               # install Electron and all dependencies
```

**Launch the app:**
```bash
npm run desktop           # opens the Specdown Desktop window
```

**Build the DMG locally (macOS only):**
```bash
npm run desktop:build     # produces a .dmg in dist/
```

Requires Node.js (v18+) installed on your machine.

#### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Runs the full Jest test suite (unit + integration). All tests must pass before committing.

#### Modifying the App

1. **Styling**: Edit `markdown-viewer/styles.css` for visual changes
2. **Functionality**: Edit `markdown-viewer/app.js` for behavior changes
3. **Structure**: Edit `markdown-viewer/index.html` for layout changes
4. **Electron main process**: Edit `desktop/main.js`
5. **IPC bridge**: Edit `desktop/preload.js`

#### Adding Features

The codebase is organized into clear sections:

```javascript
// app.js structure
- Global State
- DOM Elements
- Initialization
- Theme Management
- Event Listeners
